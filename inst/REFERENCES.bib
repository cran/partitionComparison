  Abstract                 = {Albatineh et al. (2006) introduced a family L of similarity indices. Members of this family are linear functions of the matching counts matrix [mij], where mij is the number of common elements between the i th and j th clusters resulting from two clusterings of the same data set. Fowlkes and Mallows (1983) derived the mean and variance for Rand (1971) index and an index they called Bk (which is actually attributed to Ochiai, 1957) under fixed marginal totals of the matching counts matrix and independence of the clustering algorithms. This paper generalizes the derivation of Fowlkes and Mallows (1983) for the mean and variance to any member of the L family which makes the problem of comparison of a wide family of indices much easier. Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to compare shapes, means and variances for nine members of the L family for null case data (without clustering structure). Structured case simulations are implemented to evaluate the nine indices as tools for measuring cluster structure recovery. Data were generated from bivariate normal distributions.},

Assoc. 846--850] is introduced in this paper. The Rand index is a traditional criterion for assessment and comparison of different results provided by classifiers and clustering algorithms. It is able to measure the quality of different hard partitions of a data set from a classification perspective, including partitions with different numbers of classes or clusters. The original Rand index is extended here by making it able to evaluate a fuzzy partition of a data set -- provided by a fuzzy clustering algorithm or a classifier with fuzzy-like outputs -- against a reference hard partition that encodes the actual (known) data classes. A theoretical formulation based on formal concepts from the fuzzy set theory is derived and used as a basis for the mathematical interpretation of the Fuzzy Rand Index proposed. The fuzzy counterparts of other (five) related indexes, namely, the Adjusted Rand Index of Hubert and Arabie, the Jaccard coefficient, the Minkowski measure, the Fowlkes--Mallows Index, and the $\Gamma$ statistics, are also derived from this formulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract When populations are cross-classified with respect to two or more classifications or polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association existing between the several polytomies. Most of the traditional measures or indices of association are based upon the standard chi-square statistic or on an assumption of underlying joint normality. In this paper a number of alternative measures are considered, almost all based upon a probabilistic model for activity to which the cross-classification may typically lead. Only the case in which the population is completely known is considered, so no question of sampling or measurement error appears. We hope, however, to publish before long some approximate distributions for sample estimators of the measures we propose, and approximate tests of hypotheses. Our major theme is that the measures of association used by an empirical investigator should not be blindly chosen because of tradition and convention only, although these factors may properly be given some weight, but should be constructed in a manner having operational meaning within the context of the particular problem. * This paper is partly an outgrowth of work sponsored by the Army, Navy, and Air Force through the Joint Services Advisory Committee for Research Groups in Applied Mathematics and Statistics by Contract No. N6ori-02035.

From this vantage point, we first give an axiomatic characterization of some criteria for comparing clusterings, including the variation of information and the unadjusted Rand index. Then we study other distances between partitions w.r.t these axioms and prove an impossibility result: there is no "sensible" criterion for comparing clusterings that is simultaneously (1) aligned with the lattice of partitions, (2) convexely additive, and (3) bounded.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider two data matrices on the same sample of n individuals, X(p \texttimes{} n), Y(q \texttimes{} n). From these matrices, geometrical representations of the sample are obtained as two configurations of n points, in R\textsuperscript{p} and R\textsuperscript{q}. It is shown that the RV-coefficient (Escoufier, 1970, 1973) can be used as a measure of similarity of the two configurations, taking into account the possibly distinct metrics to be used on them to measure the distances between points. The purpose of this paper is to show that most classical methods of linear multivariate statistical analysis can be interpreted as the search for optimal linear transformations or, equivalently, the search for optimal metrics to apply on two data matrices on the same sample; the optimality is defined in terms of the similarity of the corresponing configurations of points. which, in turn, calls for the maximization of the associated RV-coefficient. The methods studied are principal components, principal components of instrumental variables, multivariate regression, canonical vables, discriminant analysis; they are differentiated by the possible relationships existing between the two data matrices involved and by additional constraints under which the maximum of RV is to be obtained. It is also shown that the RV-coefficient can be used as a measure of goodness of a solution to the problem of discarding variables.},

Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an `appropriate' number of clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical taxonomy is defined in this book, the first to deal comprehensively with the subject, as " the numerical evaluation of the affinity or similarity between taxonomic units and the ordering of these units into taxa on the basis of their affinities ", and its outstanding aims are stated to be repeatability and objectivity. The book has ten chapters. The first is introductory, and the second is a critique of conventional taxonomic methods. The third deals with new methods, including numerical methods, comparative serology and polyphenic methods (those yielding many characters in a single technical procedure) such as chromatography, electrophoresis and infra-red spectroscopy. The fourth is an exposition of the aims and principles of numerical taxonomy. In this, the comparison is based on as many characters as possible, every character being given equal weight and over-all similarity of two entities being a function of the similarity of the many characters compared. Distinct taxa are constructed on the basis of diverse character correlations in the groups under study. The process is empirical and is independent of phylogenetic considerations. The fifth chapter is a discussion of the choice of characters, their coding for mathematical manipulation and the selection of organisms for study, and the sixth and seventh deal with the estimation of taxonomic resemblance between organisms and the grouping of organisms into taxa on the basis of these resemblances. The eighth and ninth comprise discussions of the relation of numerical taxonomy to phytogeny and palaeontology and to nomenclature and diagnostic keys. The last refers to future developments and similar work in subjects other than the classification of living creatures. Details of the mathematical methods of numerical taxonomy, illustrated by elementary examples, are given in an appendix.},
